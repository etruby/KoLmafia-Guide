## Notes

- The guide currently has solid coverage through 2019
- Coverage drops dramatically starting in 2020
- 2022 and 2023 have zero implementation
- Need to verify if some IOTMs might have generic implementations (e.g., "Libram" might cover multiple libram items)
- Should also check for Standard restrictions support for each IOTM
